/**
 * <p>
 * jTransfo can be used to convert between transfer objects (TO ot DTO) and domain objects.
 * </p><p>
 * You just have to annotate the transfer object with {@link DomainClass} to indicate the domain object
 * (either the class or the fully qualified class name).
 * </p><p>
 * By default all fields are converted, but you can use annotations to configure this:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link MappedBy}</li>
 *     <li>{@link NotMapped}</li>
 *     <li>{@link MapOnly}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ReadOnly}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ReadOnlyDomain}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p><p>
 * You can also add {@link PreConvert} or {@link PostConvert} tags on the transfer object to define code to be executed
 * before or after converting the fields.
 * </p><p>
 * When converting, the fields on the transfer objects are always used directly (as the annotations are on the fields).
 * For domain objects, the getters and setters are used when they exist (even when private).
 * </p><p>
 * When jTransfo needs to determine the object to convert to (when using {@link #convertTo(Object, Class, String...)}
 * or when converting a nested object which is null in the target) then the {@link ObjectFinder} will be used.
 * By default this always creates new objects, but you can add custom object finders to allow objects to be retrieved
 * from the database or whatever behaviour you need.
 * </p><p>
 * The conversion itself can be controlled in various ways:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When converting you can pass tags which can configure the conversion. These are considered for
 *         {@link MapOnly} and in the type converters, interceptors etc</li>
 *     <li>You can define type converters which are applied aither automatically or declared in the {@link MappedBy}
 *         or {@link MapOnly} annotations. See {@link TypeConverter}.</li>
 *     <li>You can add an interceptor to the conversion. This can be used in various way, for example to add
 *         validation or side-effect like auditing. See {@link ConvertInterceptor}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>You may also want to provide a {@link ObjectReplacer}. This can replace objects just before they are
 *         converted. This can for example be useful to detect lazy objects and replace them with proper
 *         implementations. See {@link ObjectReplacer}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>You may also want to provide a {@link ClassReplacer}. This can replace classes which are used as conversion
 *         target. It affects both {@link DomainClass} target classes and {@link #convertTo(Object, Class, String...)}
 *         target classes.
 *         This is very useful to allow replacing interfaces to implementation classes for domain objects or replacing
 *         transfer object classes to enhanced transfer objects (with more fields).
 *         You should only replace classes by child classes. See {@link ClassReplacer}.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
